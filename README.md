# Dissertation Notebooks

## Overview

This repository contains Jupyter Notebooks used in the dissertation research for pre-intervention, post-intervention, and qualitative analysis. The scripts and analyses in these notebooks were used to assess the impact of an AI-driven tool designed to support educators in creating personalized and curriculum-aligned instructional materials.

### Notebooks:

1. **Pre-Intervention Analysis:**
   - This notebook performs the initial data analysis before the intervention. The analysis includes qualitative and quantitative evaluations of educator feedback on the challenges faced in creating personalized materials.

2. **Pre-Intervention Qualitative Analysis:**
   - This notebook focuses on the qualitative analysis of the feedback collected in the pre-intervention stage. It uses thematic analysis and other techniques to uncover key themes in the responses.

3. **Intervention Analysis:**
   - This notebook focuses on the core intervention process and analyzes the usage of the AI tool by educators. It evaluates the time spent on lesson planning and the toolâ€™s effectiveness in meeting curriculum-aligned goals during the intervention period.
